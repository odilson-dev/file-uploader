## About

The **file-uploader** app is a multi-page web application designed to provide users with secure file storage and management capabilities. With user authentication, users can create folders, upload files, and organize their data efficiently. This app does not use single-page architecture (SPA), opting for server-side rendering instead for page navigation and data display.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in.
- **File Management**: Upload, view, and delete files.
- **Folder Management**: Organize files within custom folders.
- **Share Links**: Generate public URLs to share files.
- **Download files**: Allow users to download files.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and custom error pages.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express**: Backend server and routing
- **Prisma ORM**: Database management and querying
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user data, file info, and folder structure
- **Supabase**: File storage and public URL generation for file downloads
- **EJS**: Template engine for server-side rendering (multi-page application)
- **Passport.js**: User authentication and session management
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads
- **TailwindCSS**: Basic styling for a clean, responsive UI

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** or **pnpm** installed.
- A **PostgreSQL** database.
